		additional activities of different types. Our venues provide lots of space for some extra fun...
	</p>
	<p>
		Stroll around and get some inspiration from our side activities. Socialise with other attendees offline and seize

	<p>
		Communication with your environment is an essential part of everyone's life. And it doesn't matter 
		whether you are actually living in a rural area in the middle of nowhere, within the pulsating heart 
		of a big city, or in my case on a wonderful island in the Indian Ocean. The ability to exchange your thoughts, 
		your experience and your worries with another person helps you to get different points of view and new 
		ideas on how to resolve an issue you might be confronted with.
	</p>
	<p>
		Take the chance to exchange with other attendees in the reception area or on the balcony. Have some interesting
		conversations about software development, latest information gained during one of the presentations and let others
		know about your ups &amp; downs in your projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, join the Mauritius Software Craftsmanship Community and be part of the local IT community.

	<p>
		The Developers Conference is a great chance to show your programming skills. Team up with other developers
		and solve a variety of challenging tasks. There will be different categories of competitions and we will
		organise different prices for the winners and runner-ups.
	</p>
	<p>
		A hack-a-thon is not only fun but also a solid way to put your skills on the table. Be part of it...

    <p>
        Working with computers is bound to typing your source code, specifications or any kind of documentation via keyboard since decades.
        New alternatives like speech recognition are still in their early phase of development and practical use. Which leads us ultimately
        to the following questions:
    </p>
    <p>
        Do you know about touch-typing or speedtyping? How good are your skills?
    </p>
    <p>
        Show us and other participants your impressive speedtyping skills and compete among each other in various competitions and races. 
        The typing speed is usually measured in words-per-minute (WPM), and a word is standardized to five characters or keystrokes.
